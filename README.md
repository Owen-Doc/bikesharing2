# Visualizing the customer base of Citi Bike rentals in New York City
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to visualize demographic information of Citi Bike users in New York City. I used Tableau public to create visualizations, as well a story to tie it all together. This analysis will be used to explore the viability of a similar bike sharing program in Des Moines, Iowa, so I aimed to give investors a better picture of how the bike sharing business operates in NYC.
## Results
The Tableau story can be found here:

Seen here is a visualization of the duration of trips taken. As we see above, most Citi Bike's trips are between 0-40 minutes for all groups. There are very few trips that exceed 1 hour in duration. The graph on the right hand side shows a gender breakdown of trip duration behavior. Both men and women have similar behaviors in how long they rent their Citi Bike's, which implies they have similar needs and distances that they travel on their bikes.

It is also important to understand when bike's are being used. The above heatmap shows the distribution of trips taken by hour and by each weekday. The chart on the left shows data from all groups, while the chart on the right can be filtered by each gender. In the above image the data is filtered for female users. This heatmap clearly shows that there is significant demand for Citi Bike's for people commuting to the office, shown by the high density of rides taken from 7-9AM and 5-7PM. Bike rentals do not take off until later in the day on the weekends, with a significant increase in rides starting at 9AM and continuing through the day. Additionally, this heatmap shows that bike maintenance would be optimally performed from 1-4AM when needed, as there is lower demand for bikes at these times.

Citi Bike users can pay a $15/month subscription fee for unlimited rides less than 45 minutes, or can pay $3.50 for a single ride under 30 minutes, with a $.18/minute fee included after the 30 minutes is up. The above heatmap shows the behaviors of subscribers and nonsubscribers broken down by each day of the week and by gender. I also included the general trip breakdown for all riders as a comparison. On the heatmap on the left, we see that male subscribers consistently are the highest users of Citi Bikes throughout the week. During the week, their utilization is higher but it is still strong on the weekends. Male subscribers clearly make up a significant portion of Citi Bike's customer base. For nonsubscribers, the data is inconclusive on utilization behavior when comparing groups, as they are all relatively small portions of overall rides. The female subscriber market appears to have a decent presence throughout the week as well.

These maps shows the most popular places to start and stop a Citi Bike ride by location. Clearly, Manhattan accounts for the highest number of rides taken. There is a small cluster of riders north of the city as well. Since we know that most rides are under 40 minutes, it makes intuitive sense that the start and stop locations would not be drastically different, as riders are likely not traveling further than a few miles. This map can be zoomed in on to illustrate clusters of riders in different parts of Manhattan. This map may be useful in determing where a service station might need to be established, so that bikes can travel a minimal distance to be serviced. Additionally, this map can help fuel marketing efforts in specific neighborhoods. 

## Summary
There is consistent demand throughout the week for Citi Bikes in New York City. Subscribers clearly depend on bikes for transportation to work during the week, as well as on the weekends. Non subscribers, who may be tourists, also use the bikes almost evenly across the weekdays and weekend. Another visualization I'd want to explore is to further segment the non-subscriber market. I'd want to see where they were traveling, and how long their trips were, as this would help identify if they are tourists or residents. If they are residents, it would be interesting to understand better why they have not subscribed and continue to pay the per-use fee. If they are tourists, I'd also want to know where their renting start locations are clustered, and potentially increase bike availability in these locations to drive sales. 
Another visualization I'd want to create is a year-long time series analysis to see how rider behavior changes throughout the year. This data is for the month of August, which is typically very hot and muggy in NYC. This may change how commuters, who I know are a strong market in August, utilize bikes, if they do not want to exhert themselves on a hot day and arrive to work sweaty, as they may seek another mode of transportation. Additionally, I'd want to see just how much utilization falls in colder months, and get an idea for a riders "breaking point" when it comes to whether. What temperature are they no longer willing to withstand to ride a bike to work versus taking the train or bus?
